== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I configure shipping rates based on weight using the plugin? =
Absolutely. You can easily configure the rates based on weight slabs. For more info, you can check the screenshots and the explanation on the product page - https://wordpress.org/plugins/weight-country-woocommerce-shipping/
= I want to define cost per unit weight. Will this plugin do the job? =
Yes. Using the plugin, you can define cost/weight. From this screenshot, you can see how to do that - https://ps.w.org/weight-country-woocommerce-shipping/assets/screenshot-1.png?rev=1094105
= Using the plugin, is it possible to set up free for a particular country =
Yes, it is very much possible. You can just create a rule for a country and in place of â€œBase Costâ€?, set a value of 0. This will create a free shipping rule for that country.
= I want to have shipping rates based on shipping class. For some products, a rate of $5, for another set of products, a rate of $10 should be charged. Is that possible using this plugin? =
The basic version of the plugin does not support shipping classes. However, using the premium plugin, you can fulfil this case very eloquently. Here is an example - https://www.xadapter.com/woocommerce-shipping-pro-chapter-6-per-shipping-class/
= I want to bundle DVDs, books and many other products and show only one shipping price when they are bought together. Is it possible? = 
Using the basic version of the plugin, it is a little tricky to achieve this. However, using the premium version, you can do that pretty easily. Here is an article to fulfil the exact case - https://www.xadapter.com/woocommerce-shipping-pro-chapter-3-bundle-rate-shipping/
